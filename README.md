# spacetraders-data-platform
fullstack datascience sandbox
----------------------------

A modular data platform built around the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io/), designed as a learning project for data engineering and data science.  
It demonstrates **API integration, ETL pipelines, SQL databases, analytics, visualization, and testing** — all with production-style structure.

## 📌 Features
- **API Client**: Robust Python client with rate-limit handling and caching
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extract/Transform/Load workflows (Prefect/Airflow-ready)
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL/SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Analytics**: Trade route profitability, fleet allocation, contracts
- **Dashboards**: Streamlit app with real-time fleet and market insights
- **Testing & CI/CD**: Pytest, linting, and GitHub Actions for automation
- **Dockerized**: Fully reproducible environment
