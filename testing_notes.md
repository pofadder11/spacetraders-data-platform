TESTING NOTES

🤖 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that:

- Installs dependencies
- Runs lint checks
- Runs pytest
- (Optional) Builds Docker image

Every pull request and push to main will automatically trigger these checks.

# 🔍 GitHub Actions, Linting, and Testing (explained)

## 1. **Testing**
- You’ll use **pytest** to write tests for each module.
- Types:
  - **Unit tests** → test a single function (e.g., `parse_ship_data()`).
  - **Integration tests** → test interactions (e.g., API fetch → database insert).
  - **End-to-end tests** → run a small ETL pipeline on fake data and assert outputs.

👉 Benefit: catches regressions early, keeps code modular.  

---

## 2. **Linting**
- Tools like **flake8**, **black**, and **isort** check **style, formatting, and imports**.
- Purpose:
  - Makes code **consistent** and readable.
  - Avoids bugs from sloppy patterns (unused imports, bad indentation, etc.).
- Example:
  ```bash
  flake8 .       # style issues
  black .        # auto-format code
  isort .        # auto-sort imports

3. GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline)

CI = Continuous Integration → automatically test/lint code on every push/PR.

CD = Continuous Deployment → optional (e.g., auto-deploy Streamlit to Streamlit Cloud).

Workflow:

Every push → GitHub spins up a VM → installs dependencies → runs tests + lint.

If anything fails → you see a red ❌ on GitHub before merging.

If everything passes → green ✅ means code is safe.

👉 Benefit: shows professionalism, prevents “it works on my machine” issues.

🧱 Strong Testing Protocol (fresh start plan)

If you want to be serious about robustness, here’s a suggested approach:

Every module must have tests.

Example: api/client.py → tests/test_api.py

Use pytest fixtures to mock API responses so you’re not hammering the real API.

Write integration tests for the ETL pipeline.

Use a temporary SQLite DB in memory (sqlite:///:memory:).

Test “fetch → transform → load → query result”.

Test dashboards and decision logic.

Example: mock DB query returns → test if chart renders without errors.

Enforce linting + formatting.

Run black --check and flake8 in CI.

Automate it with GitHub Actions.

Create .github/workflows/ci.yml with jobs:

lint → run black/flake8

test → run pytest

build (optional) → build Docker image

👉 Net effect: you’ll have a repo that is:

Modular (clean separation of API/ETL/DB/analytics).

Robust (unit + integration tested).

Professional (CI pipeline, linting, reproducibility).
